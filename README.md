### Hi there üëã
This is a copy of my website https://sites.google.com/view/realize-the-reality for backup.

The website is about seeing the world from an aerial view not literally but to show whats happening and what should be done to make things fall in place.

And *what should be done?*

Elimination of money 


What??
Why?
How?


Here

## Summary

Almost everything is connected..

Money ruins things

(Creates inequality , messes up minds , pushes for more ,keeps unsatisfied , crimes , environmental degradation , health  etc.)

How to eliminate Money WITHOUT compromising on anything ?

Being Self sufficient in Homestead 

Growing own food ( Permaculture  -Natural way of growing food)

Making own stuff DIY , Working through willing cooperation , 

Poverty , inequalities , crimes , transportation , pollution , waste , diseases etc. Will become negligible...


= Healthier , happier , better sharing of knowledge , focus on things like Space..


THIS ISN'T  ABOUT ELIMINATING MONEY FROM YOUR LIVES OR EVERYONE'S 

THIS IS ABOUT ELIMINATING INEQUALITIES , 

ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION 

CRIMES ( WHICH TO ME SEEMS A REASON BIG ENOUGH )

ETC.


WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WITHOUT MONEY TOO BUT BETTER AND WITHOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS.
